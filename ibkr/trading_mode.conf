# This file controls whether live trading is enabled.
# The executor will REFUSE to connect to live ports unless
# TRADING_MODE is explicitly set to "live" below.
#
# To enable live trading:
#   1. Open this file
#   2. Change TRADING_MODE=paper to TRADING_MODE=live
#   3. Save the file
#   4. Run the executor with --live flag
#
# After your live session, change it back to "paper" for safety.
#
