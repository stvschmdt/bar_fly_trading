================================================================================
  TIER 1 — HIGH VALUE, DIRECT ML IMPACT
================================================================================

1. NEWS_SENTIMENT
   ─────────────
   Endpoint:    function=NEWS_SENTIMENT
   Params:      tickers=NVDA, topics=earnings, time_from/time_to=YYYYMMDDTHHMM,
                sort=RELEVANCE, limit=1000
   Frequency:   Continuous (aggregate to daily for our pipeline)
   Returns:     Per-article: title, source, sentiment_score, relevance_score
                Per-ticker:  ticker_sentiment_score (-0.35 to +0.35),
                             ticker_relevance_score (0 to 1),
                             ticker_sentiment_label (Bearish/Neutral/Bullish)

   WHY: Sentiment is the single biggest feature gap in our pipeline. Our
   strategies (especially oversold_bounce, oversold_reversal) react to price
   drops but have no way to distinguish "healthy pullback" from "bad news
   selloff." Aggregated daily sentiment scores give the model context for
   whether a dip is likely to reverse or continue.

   STORAGE: New table `news_sentiment` with columns:
     date, symbol, article_count, avg_sentiment, avg_relevance,
     bullish_count, bearish_count, neutral_count
   Aggregate per symbol per day. One API call per symbol per day.

   DERIVED FEATURES FOR ML:
     - sentiment_1d (today's avg sentiment)
     - sentiment_3d_mean (3-day rolling avg)
     - sentiment_momentum (today - 3d mean)
     - news_volume (article count — high = event-driven)

   API CALLS: ~1 per symbol per day (filter by ticker). With 37 symbols
   that's 37 calls/day — well within rate limits.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2. INCOME_STATEMENT + BALANCE_SHEET + CASH_FLOW
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   Endpoint:    function=INCOME_STATEMENT, BALANCE_SHEET, CASH_FLOW
   Params:      symbol=NVDA
   Frequency:   Quarterly (and annual) — updates when company reports earnings
   Returns:     Full financial statements (GAAP/IFRS normalized):
                - Income: totalRevenue, grossProfit, operatingIncome, netIncome,
                  ebitda, costOfRevenue, researchAndDevelopment
                - Balance: totalAssets, totalLiabilities, totalShareholderEquity,
                  totalCurrentAssets, totalCurrentLiabilities, cashAndEquivalents,
                  longTermDebt, shortTermDebt
                - Cash flow: operatingCashflow, capitalExpenditures,
                  freeCashFlow, dividendPayout, shareRepurchase

   WHY: We currently only have OVERVIEW (single snapshot) and EARNINGS
   (just EPS). Full financials let us derive:
     - Revenue growth rate (QoQ, YoY) — the #1 fundamental signal
     - Operating/gross margins and margin trends
     - Debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio (liquidity)
     - Free cash flow yield (FCF / market_cap)
     - R&D intensity (R&D / revenue) — matters for tech stocks

   Our pe_ratio feature has look-ahead bias from OVERVIEW. These quarterly
   reports have specific fiscalDateEnding dates, so we can properly align
   them temporally — no look-ahead.

   STORAGE: New tables `income_statement`, `balance_sheet`, `cash_flow`
   with PK (symbol, fiscalDateEnding). Pull once per symbol, then
   incremental quarterly.

   DERIVED FEATURES FOR ML (ffilled like earnings):
     - revenue_growth_yoy (totalRevenue YoY pct change)
     - gross_margin (grossProfit / totalRevenue)
     - operating_margin (operatingIncome / totalRevenue)
     - debt_to_equity (totalLiabilities / totalShareholderEquity)
     - current_ratio (totalCurrentAssets / totalCurrentLiabilities)
     - fcf_yield (freeCashFlow / market_capitalization)

   API CALLS: 3 per symbol (one-time backfill), then 3 per symbol quarterly.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3. COMMODITIES: WTI, NATURAL_GAS, COPPER
   ──────────────────────────────────────
   Endpoint:    function=WTI, function=NATURAL_GAS, function=COPPER
   Params:      interval=daily
   Frequency:   Daily
   Returns:     date, value (spot price)

   WHY: Commodity prices are macro regime features that affect large swaths
   of equities. Oil prices correlate with energy stocks, transportation costs,
   and inflation expectations. Copper is a leading indicator of industrial
   activity ("Dr. Copper"). Natural gas affects utilities and manufacturing.
   These are daily frequency — perfect match for our data.

   STORAGE: Add columns to economic_indicators table:
     wti_price, natural_gas_price, copper_price
   Same pattern as treasury yields — daily, ffilled for missing days.

   DERIVED FEATURES FOR ML:
     - wti_ret_1d, wti_ret_5d (daily/weekly oil returns)
     - copper_ret_5d (industrial activity proxy)
     - wti_vol_10d (energy volatility regime)

   API CALLS: 3 total (one per commodity). Daily incremental.

  TIER 2 — MODERATE VALUE, STRATEGY-SPECIFIC
================================================================================

4. EARNINGS_CALENDAR
   ─────────────────
   Endpoint:    function=EARNINGS_CALENDAR
   Params:      horizon=3month, symbol=NVDA (optional)
   Frequency:   Updated continuously, pull weekly
   Returns:     CSV with: symbol, name, reportDate, fiscalDateEnding,
                estimate, currency

   WHY: Knowing WHEN earnings are coming is critical for risk management.
   Our strategies could:
     - Avoid entering positions within N days of earnings (high vol event)
     - Size down positions approaching earnings
     - Create an "earnings_proximity" feature (days until next earnings)
   Currently we have no way to know if earnings are 2 days or 2 months away.

   STORAGE: New table `earnings_calendar` (symbol, report_date, estimate).
   Or just a derived feature in gold_table_processing.

   DERIVED FEATURES FOR ML:
     - days_to_earnings (countdown — strong vol predictor)
     - earnings_week (binary: is earnings within 5 trading days?)

   API CALLS: 1 call for all symbols (bulk CSV endpoint).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

5. ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL INDICATORS: OBV, STOCH, MFI, NATR, AROON
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Endpoint:    function=OBV, STOCH, MFI, NATR, AROON
   Params:      symbol, interval=daily, time_period=14 (where applicable)
   Frequency:   Daily (same as our existing technicals)
   Returns:     date + indicator value(s)

   a) OBV (On-Balance Volume)
      - No time_period needed (cumulative)
      - Tracks volume flowing in/out — a divergence between OBV and price
        signals trend reversals. We track volume_pct but not cumulative
        volume pressure. Complements our volume-based features.

   b) STOCH (Stochastic Oscillator)
      - Params: fastkperiod=14, slowkperiod=3, slowdperiod=3
      - Returns: SlowK, SlowD (both 0-100 bounded)
      - Mean-reversion signal that complements RSI. RSI looks at magnitude
        of moves; stochastic looks at where close falls within the range.
        Our oversold_bounce and oversold_reversal strategies would benefit.

   c) MFI (Money Flow Index) — time_period=14
      - "Volume-weighted RSI" — 0-100 bounded
      - Incorporates volume into overbought/oversold detection.
        Currently our signals use RSI (price only) and volume_pct
        (volume only) separately. MFI combines them.

   d) NATR (Normalized ATR) — time_period=14
      - ATR as percentage of close price (cross-stock comparable)
      - We have raw ATR, but a $5 stock with ATR=0.50 and a $500 stock with
        ATR=5.00 have the same 1% NATR. This makes volatility comparable
        across our universe without manual normalization.

   e) AROON (Aroon Oscillator) — time_period=14
      - Returns: Aroon Up, Aroon Down (0-100)
      - Measures how long since the highest high and lowest low.
        Identifies trend strength and direction differently from ADX.
        ADX says "is there a trend?" AROON says "is the trend starting
        or ending?"

   STORAGE: Add to technical_indicators table:
     obv, stoch_k, stoch_d, mfi_14, natr_14, aroon_up, aroon_down

   API CALLS: 5 per symbol (one-time backfill). 185 total for 37 symbols.
   At 140 req/min, that's ~1.3 minutes. Daily incremental: same 185 calls.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6. FX_DAILY: USD/EUR, USD/JPY
   ──────────────────────────
   Endpoint:    function=FX_DAILY
   Params:      from_symbol=USD, to_symbol=EUR (or JPY)
   Frequency:   Daily
   Returns:     date, open, high, low, close (exchange rate)

   WHY: Dollar strength (DXY proxy) affects:
     - Export-heavy companies (weaker dollar = higher foreign revenue)
     - Commodity prices (inverse correlation)
     - International fund flows
   USD/JPY specifically tracks risk appetite (yen = safe haven).
   These are daily, match our format, and are global macro features
   that apply to all symbols equally (like treasury yields).

   STORAGE: Add to economic_indicators:
     usd_eur, usd_jpy
   Or create new fx_data table.

   DERIVED FEATURES FOR ML:
     - usd_eur_ret_1d, usd_jpy_ret_1d (daily FX returns)
     - dollar_strength_5d (5-day rolling USD/EUR return)

   API CALLS: 2 total. Daily incremental.

================================================================================
  TIER 3 — NICE TO HAVE, LOWER PRIORITY
================================================================================

7. REAL_GDP
   ────────
   Endpoint:    function=REAL_GDP
   Params:      interval=quarterly
   Frequency:   Quarterly
   Returns:     date, value (GDP in billions)

   WHY: GDP growth rate is the broadest macro regime indicator. Regime
   detection (expansion vs contraction) could help the model adjust
   strategy aggressiveness. However, it's quarterly and lagged — GDP
   data is released ~1 month after quarter end. Lower frequency means
   less ML signal compared to daily features.

   DERIVED: gdp_growth_qoq (quarterly pct change). Ffill like CPI.
   API CALLS: 1 total.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

8. DIVIDENDS
   ─────────
   Endpoint:    function=DIVIDENDS
   Params:      symbol=NVDA
   Frequency:   Per-event (typically quarterly for dividend payers)
   Returns:     ex_dividend_date, declaration_date, record_date,
                payment_date, amount

   WHY: Ex-dividend dates cause mechanical price drops equal to the
   dividend amount. Without knowing this, our models might interpret
   an ex-div drop as a bearish signal. Also useful for:
     - Dividend capture strategies
     - Adjusting stop-loss thresholds around ex-div dates
   Lower priority because most of our universe is growth/tech stocks
   with low or no dividends.

   DERIVED: is_ex_div (binary), days_to_ex_div, annual_div_yield
   API CALLS: 1 per symbol (37 total, one-time).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

9. CRYPTO_DAILY: BTC/USD
   ─────────────────────
   Endpoint:    function=DIGITAL_CURRENCY_DAILY
   Params:      symbol=BTC, market=USD
   Frequency:   Daily
   Returns:     date, open, high, low, close, volume, market_cap

   WHY: Bitcoin has become a risk-on/risk-off barometer. BTC daily
   returns correlate with tech stocks and growth names (our universe).
   BTC volatility spikes often precede equity vol spikes. However,
   the correlation is noisy and regime-dependent. Lower priority
   than commodities and FX.

   DERIVED: btc_ret_1d, btc_ret_5d, btc_vol_5d
   API CALLS: 1 total. Daily incremental.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

10. EARNINGS_ESTIMATES (Forward Estimates)
    ──────────────────────────────────────
    Endpoint:    function=EARNINGS_ESTIMATES  (Premium?)
    Params:      symbol=NVDA
    Frequency:   Quarterly (updates as analysts revise)
    Returns:     fiscalDateEnding, consensus estimate, number of analysts,
                 high/low estimates

    WHY: Earnings estimate revisions are one of the strongest fundamental
    alpha signals in quant finance. Rising estimates = bullish, falling =
    bearish. Currently we only have historical actual EPS. Forward
    estimates would let us compute:
      - Estimate revision momentum (current vs 30-day-ago consensus)
      - Forward PE ratio (price / forward_eps) — better than trailing PE
    Lower priority because this may require premium tier and the data
    is harder to historicize.

    DERIVED: forward_eps, estimate_revision_pct, forward_pe_ratio
    API CALLS: 1 per symbol per quarter.

  Daily total (Tier 1-2):             ~228 calls
  Current daily usage:                ~222 calls (37 sym x 6 endpoints)
  Combined:                           ~450 calls/day
  Rate limit:                         150/min = 9000/hr — easily fits

================================================================================
  NOTES
================================================================================

  - All suggested data matches our daily granularity (or lower-frequency
    ffilled to daily, same pattern as economic indicators).

  - NEWS_SENTIMENT is the single biggest bang-for-buck addition. It's the
    only source of "why" context for price moves. Every other feature we
    have is derived from price/volume/fundamentals — adding sentiment
    gives the model an orthogonal signal dimension.

  - Financial statements (INCOME/BALANCE/CASH) fix the look-ahead bias
    problem identified in the storage.py review. Unlike OVERVIEW (single
    snapshot), these have proper fiscalDateEnding timestamps for temporal
    alignment.

  - Commodities + FX are "free" macro features — 5 API calls/day, apply
    to all 37 symbols equally (like treasury yields do now).
